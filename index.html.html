<H2> Biography of BLACKPINK </H2>

<P> Blackpink (Korean: 블랙핑크; RR: Beullaekpingkeu, stylized in all caps or as BLɅϽKPIИK) is a South Korean girl group formed by YG Entertainment and consisting of members 
    Jisoo, Jennie, Rosé, and Lisa. Cited as the "biggest girl group in the world", they are considered the most successful Korean girl group internationally and a leading force 
    in the Korean Wave. They are stylistically associated with the "girl crush" concept in K-pop—exploring themes of self-confidence and female empowerment.

<P> Blackpink debuted in August 2016 with their single album Square One, which featured "Whistle" and "Boombayah", their first number-one entries on South Korea's 
    Gaon Digital Chart and the US Billboard World Digital Songs chart, respectively. It was followed by the single album Square Two in November, whose song "Playing with Fire" 
    was the first by a Korean girl group to enter the Billboard Canadian Hot 100. The group expanded their global reach with "Ddu-Du Ddu-Du" (2018), which was the first song by a
    Korean female group to enter the UK Singles Chart and receive a certification in the United States. Its music video was the first by a Korean group to surpass one and two 
    billion views on YouTube, and remains the most-viewed by a Korean group to date. Their music videos for "Kill This Love" (2019) and "How You Like That" (2020) each set records
    for the most-viewed music video within the first 24 hours of release, with the latter breaking five Guinness World Records.
